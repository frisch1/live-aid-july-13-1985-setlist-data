# Live Aid - July 13, 1985
## Setlists + DVD Tracks as Structured Data (with Timings)
Don't ask. A project to organize my DVDs in my video library led to this rathole.
The Excel files and TSV files are identical, just one with formatting.
The setlist pulls from a number of sources and includes:

* http://liveaid.free.fr/pages/liveaidtimesdetaileduk.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Aid
* https://www.setlist.fm/festivals/live-aid-13d6b9c1.html

Times were checked against the simulcasts.

Note for the overall timing, the individual times -- both London and Philadelphia, are accurate and two-sourced.

This data includes the track list and timing for the 4-Disc Live AID DVD set, plus the full 16-hour simulcasts of MTV and BBC from the day. It also includes a setlist and timing (by set) for the four-hour Oz for Australia.

The mapping to the BBC and MTV simulcasts has a little drift to it due to the 1985 recordings. Assume timing specific to simulcasts may drift 1-2 minutes, though it's corrected at two-hour intervals to adjust.

I claim no copyright or ownership of this data (nor are there any videos here... go buy them!] However, someone is organizing their collection in the future, hopefully this data helps to put the right tracks in the right order.

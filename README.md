# Live Aid - July 13, 1985
I'm old enough to remember watching bits and pieces in the counselor lounge at [Camp Chen-a-Wanda](https://www.chenawanda.com/) in 1985. It was a great set. It's gotten a little more notice form a new generation via [Bohemian Rhapsody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody_[film]) in 2018, but it's missing the historical context of the pre-Internet, pre-1,000 channel cable world. If 1.9 billion people were watching, including *behind the Iron Curtain*, that was a huge deal. Phil Collins jumping the Concorde to play both Wembley and Philadelphia... it was a mind bender.

Hell, at Camp Chen-a-Wanda, I forget what negotiations went on and I think the owner shared his cable hookup in rural Thompson, Pensylvania lest the counselors flee *en masse* to Philadelphia.

## Setlists + DVD Tracks as Structured Data [with Timings]
Anyway, I found the DVD on eBay and ripped it, and was surprised about half the concert was missing. That led to this investigation, and piecing together the full set list, broadcast vs. actual times, etc. The outcome of this I figured I'd share to help anyone else. It was a complete rathole, but at least there's clean data now for:
* The full four-disc [Live Aid DVD](https://www.amazon.com/Live-Aid-4-Disc-Set/dp/B0002Z9HT8/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=live+aid+1985+dvd&qid=1668378434&sr=8-1)
* The [BBC Simulcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHjXlgBYt3s&list=PLI-pezvNEo4_RqAqFsaprCmKCPMGE4x3V)
* The [MTV Simulcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEcjI0AU6TaYVqDe412kMSWlPgWokUMLT)
* The [Oz for Africa](https://archive.org/details/1985.07.13_LIVE_AID_30_The_MTV_Broadcast_OZ_For_Africa_Full_4_hour_concert_Austr) show

## Videos
You can find the videos of varying provenance on YouTube and the Internet Archive. FWIW, the Internet Archive seems to be the whole enchilada:

## Other Details
**Note: If anyone knows -- with sources -- the exact start time, AEST, of Oz for Africa, it's the one datapoint we're missing. It gets cited as "12 hours before" which would equate to 9 am AEST -- that doesn't sound right for a concert.**

Times were checked against the simulcasts. You can find folks who pieced it together online on YouTube from the BBC and YouTube (links above). 

Note for the overall timing, the individual times -- both London and Philadelphia, are accurate and two-sourced.

This data includes the track list and timing for the 4-Disc Live AID DVD set, plus the full 16-hour simulcasts of MTV and BBC from the day. It also includes a setlist and timing (by set) for the four-hour Oz for Australia.

The mapping to the BBC and MTV simulcasts has a little drift to it due to the 1985 recordings. Assume timing specific to simulcasts may drift 1-2 minutes, though it's corrected at two-hour intervals to adjust.

I claim no copyright or ownership of this data (nor are there any videos here... go buy them!] However, someone is organizing their collection in the future, hopefully this data helps to put the right tracks in the right order.

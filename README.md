# live-aid-setlist-data
Don't ask. A project to organize my DVDs in my video library led to this rathole.
The Excel files and TSV files are identical, just one with formatting.
The setlist pulls from a number of sources and includes http://liveaid.free.fr/pages/liveaidtimesdetaileduk.html, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Aid and https://www.setlist.fm/festivals/live-aid-13d6b9c1.html, checked against the simulcasts.

Note for the overall timing, the individual times -- both London and Philadelphia, are accurate and two-sourced.

The mapping to the BBC and MTV simulcasts has a little drift to it due to the 1985 recordings. Assume timing specific to simulcasts may drift 1-2 minutes, though it's corrected at two-hour intervals to adjust.

We claim no copyright or ownership of this data. If someone is organizing their collection in the future, hopefully this data helps to put the right tracks in the right order.
